# drv

> "I mean, why not?"

`drv` is a simple CLI wrapper for Google Drive. Unlike solutions like [rakyll](https://github.com/rakyll)'s [drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive), `drv` wraps an already-existing Drive install and supports Drive's traditional auto-sync functionality.

Features:
- [x] Upload files  
- [ ] Move files around in Drive
- [ ] Edit document files
